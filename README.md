# NLP: Sentiment Analysis - Reviews

The present system analyses a *train dataset* of labelled (*Positive / Negative*) Rotten Tomatoes reviews through a *Naive Bayes* approach, and attempts to classify the sentiment of the reviews in three *test datasets*:

* The *dataset used for training*;
* A *test dataset of Rotten Tomatoes' reviews*;
* A *test dataset of Nokia reviews* (hence, a different domain).

For comparison, there is also a *Rule-based* approach. 

These two approaches **were already implemented** by *Dr. Chenghua Lin* for the course of *Data Mining & Visualization* in the *University of Aberdeen*. 
The authors analyzed these approaches thoroughly in a report format, and implemented an improved version of the *Rule-based* approach based in *sentence polarity*.
